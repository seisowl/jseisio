jseisIO is an open source C++ written library for parallel input/output 
of seismic data in JavaSeis format. The JavaSeis package (http://www.javaseis.org), 
written in Java programming language, was used as a guideline to understand the
non-documented JavaSeis format. 
jseisIO was developed at Fraunhofer ITWM (http://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de) 
with a goal to have a compact and fast C++ implementation of the IO part of the 
original Java-written library. 


To build the library CMake 2.6.4 or newer is required (http://www.cmake.org).
Binary packages for all major operating systems can be downloaded here: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
To build it:
 - enter the source directory
 - create a subdirectory "build" for building (this step is optional, but  strongly recommended)
 - enter the build directory
 - run cmake pointing to the source directory: cmake ..
 - run make


jseisIO uses also two free external packages - miniz 
(see http://code.google.com/p/miniz/) and tinyxml (see http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/).

For examples of reading and writing of javaseis files see testReader.cpp and 
testWriter.cpp, respectively.
